It won't actually put Drupal in there, it won't\nactually create or configure databases or redis or memcached or solr. Example\ncookbooks for this will come along as part of integration testing efforts.\n\n```\ndrupal_site 'foo.net' do\nroot    '/var/drupals/foo'\nconfig({\n  'database' => {\n    'default' => {\n      'default' => {\n        database => 'fooDB',\n        username => 'fooDBA',\n        password => 'fooPASS',\n      }\n    }\n  }\n})\nend\n```\n\nThe following example installs drush of the given version\n```\ndrush '8.x-6.x-dev'\n```\n\n# Attributes\n\nnode['drupal']['drush']['version'] -- the version of drush to install\n(drupal.org version string)\n\nnode['drupal']['sites_dir'] -- the base path for sites installed with the dbag\nrecipe\n\nnode['drupal']['data_bag'] -- the data bag whose items represent drupal config\nfor the dbag recipe\n\nnode['drupal']['data_bag_items'] -- the items of the data bag whose items represent\ndrupal config for the dbag recipe\n\nnode['drupal']['shared_dir'] -- the path to which to download shared drupal\nlibraries distributed as modules for things like cache backends\n\n# Recipes\n\ndefault: provisions the node with a working LAMP stack for Drupal\n\nnode\\_sites: a simple way to invoke the LWRP from your Vagrantfile -- pretty\njanky, not especially happy with it, but I feel that multi-tenant drupals is\na pretty important goal and forcing people to knife some data_bags and roles\nand is exactly what I don't want to do.\n\ndata\\_bags: allows you to ship configuration in data bags (see attributes)\n\n# Author\n\nAuthor:: Will Milton (<will@prometsource.com>)\n","maintainer":"Will Milton","maintainer_email":"wa.milton@gmail.com","license":"Apache 2.0","platforms":{},"dependencies":{"ark":">= 0.0.0","hostsfile":">= 0.0.0","php":">= 0.0.0","apache2":">= 0.0.0"},"recommendations":{},"suggestions":{},"conflicting":{},"providing":{},"replacing":{},"attributes":{},"groupings":{},"recipes":{},"version":"1.2.5"}
